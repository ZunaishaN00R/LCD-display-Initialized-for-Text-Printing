# LCD Display Project

## Description

This project initializes and utilizes an LCD display to print two lines of text. Here's a breakdown of the code:

- Library Inclusion: The code includes the LiquidCrystal library for interfacing with the LCD display.
- LCD Initialization: In the `setup()` function:
  - Serial communication is initialized at a baud rate of 9600.
  - The LCD display is initialized with 16 columns and 2 rows.
  - Any existing content on the LCD display is cleared.
  - The cursor position is set to the first column of the first row.
  - The text "Zunaisha Noor" is printed on the LCD display on the first row.
  - The cursor position is set to the first column of the second row.
  - The text "Biet-f21-049" is printed on the LCD display on the second row.
- The `loop()` function is empty, indicating that the program does not contain any continuous execution logic beyond the setup phase.

This README.md file provides a brief overview of the LCD display project, explaining the setup and functionality of the code. Use this information to understand and utilize the provided code effectively.
